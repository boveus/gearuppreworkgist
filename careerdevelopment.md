# Read through 29 Behaviors That Will Make You an Unstoppable Programmer
# Approximate reading time: 20 minutes
# Pick out 3 behaviors that resonate with you in the list and describe why they resonate with you in a reflection (4-6 sentences).

* Sometimes you have to write bad code
-  This one resonated with me a lot.  I think this goes along with the idea of the sunk cost fallacy - if you spend a long time on a solution that is optimal, you may have been better off spending a short amount of time on a suboptimal solution.  This is especially important in the business sector since downtime and bugs can cost money by the minute or hour.  An okay fix now can be better than a great fix later and there is always time to improve the fix later on. With that said, a quick solution can sometimes introduce more problems.

* Move fast and break things
- I enjoyed this advice as well.  I appreciate the concept of taking an iterative approach to learning.  We aren't dealing with irreparable machinery here - code is cheap. You can continue writing bad code that breaks things in a test environment indefinitely and it won't hurt anything.  Sometimes it is a lot easier to find out the 10 ways something didn't work to find the one that does rather than spend a lot of time thinking about how to make something work.  Computers and software in general are easy to reboot, refresh, reimagine, and revert back to default settings so my general attitude is to just throw enough stuff at them to see what sticks.

* Say "I dont know" \ take criticism of your code.
- These were two thoughts that I felt were related.  They both come down to humility and not taking things personally.  It is always safer to admit to being unsure than to make yourself sound more sure than you are.  This removes any sort of doubt across the entire team, and in my experience, actually helps to instill more trust when you say you do know something.  Receiving criticism is part of being an adult.  If you don't accept criticism well then you won't be able to grow professionally or personally.  Regardless of the person saying the criticism, there is always room to grow from someone else's perspective on work you've done - and they are criticing your work, not you.


# Organization is paramount to success both at Turing and in a career as a programmer. There are many ways to stay organized, but in this activity, you’ll explore one system in particular – utilizing a strong checklist. Read through and/or listen to this interview with Atul Gawande (author of the Checklist Manifesto). It includes an excerpt from his book, which is optional reading.

# Approximate reading time (including the excerpt from the book, which is optional): 22 minutes
After reading, consider the idea of checklists. Write a reflection (4-6 sentences) on the benefits of a checklist and how an organizational system such as a checklist might help you first as a student and later as a full-time developer.

* Response
- Checklists are important for detailed tasks that require multiple things to happen to make them successful.  I am planning to use Trello boards to track my to do list and tasks that I need to accomplish during my time at Turing.  Based on the idea of a checklist, I may generate some checklists in my Trello boards for routine tasks.  I also might think about things that are referred to as a "sanity check".  I have a habit of working with people and saying my thoughts out loud to them (I suppose this is like rubber duck debugging, except with a person instead of a duck) so that I make sure everything makes sense and I am not missing something.  I think something between a checklist and a set of questions to ask myself for routine programming tasks would be good.  Something along the lines of "if you are planning a project, ask yourself these 5 questions".  As a full-time developer I can do the same thing for my routine tasks.


One tool we’ll be using for your professional development at Turing is the Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment. Unlike other assessments, one of the hallmarks of StrengthsFinder is that it focuses solely on what you’re already doing well in order to understand how to capitalize on those strengths.
